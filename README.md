# Installations
All of the code was written in Python, using Python version 3. All of the packages used are available in the Anaconda distribution. 

# Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to analyse the 2021 Stack Overflow Developer survey, to understand these three questions:
1) What was the average annual compensation for the top 3 most commonly worked with languages?

2) For the top 5 countries with the most respondants, what was the respective average annual compensation?

3) How does average annual compensation vary across gender?
